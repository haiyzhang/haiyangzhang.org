I am a doctoral candidate in the Strategy unit at Harvard Business School.

My [research](/research/) examines entry, competition, and industry dynamics in infrastructure and regulated markets. I study how ownership, regulation, and competition interact and inform firm strategy, often in settings where prices alone do not organize rivalry. Empirically, I have examined these questions in wireless spectrum, electricity generation, and other sectors.

My work is informed and inspired by my experience as a McKinsey consultant, where I served public, private, and philanthropic organizations, and as a market designer for the first North American nodal energy market.

I am committed to and enjoy teaching. I have taught or assisted in courses in strategy, entrepreneurship, and economics at the doctoral, MBA, and undergraduate levels. You can read more about my [teaching](/teaching/) and student feedback. 

Outside work, I enjoy [flying](/flying/) a Cessna 172. Flying W (N14) is my home airport. Cape May (WWD) is one of my favorite destinations.
