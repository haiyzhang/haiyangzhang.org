I am a doctoral candidate in the Strategy unit at Harvard Business School.

My [research](/research/) examines entry, competition, and industry evolution in infrastructure and regulated markets. I am interested in understanding how ownership, regulation, and competition interact and inform firm strategy, often in settings where prices alone do not organize rivalry. I have studied these questions in wireless spectrum, electricity generation, and other sectors.

My work is informed and inspired by my experience as a McKinsey consultant, where I served public, private, and philanthropic organizations, and as a market designer for the first North American nodal energy market.

I am also passionate about [teaching](/teaching/), and have taught or assisted in teaching across doctoral, MBA, and undergraduate courses.

Outside work, I enjoy [flying](/flying/) a Cessna 172. Flying W (N14) is my home airport. Cape May (WWD) is one of my favorite destinations.
